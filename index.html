        <h4>A 21st-century gold rush is taking place in Mongolia.</h4>

        <p>Its huge gold reserves were only discovered after the former Soviet satellite started democratic reforms in
            1990. Now, gold fever has gripped the country, with an estimated 100,000 Mongolians working as informal
            miners, many of them herders who have left their flocks behind.

            <br>
            <br>

            But the work of these miners is causing untold damage to the environment.

            <br>
            <br>

            Known as “ninja” miners — with their plastic gold-panning basins slung over their backs, they resemble TV’s
            Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — they do not possess the necessary mining licenses and thus operate illegally.
        </p>

        <p>But they produce more gold than the formal industrial mining sector, which alone contributes more than 20
            percent of Mongolia’s gross domestic product. So by necessity, the government turns a blind eye to the ninja
            miners.</p>

            “I spend sleepless nights thinking about where to dig to find gold,” adds another miner named Nergui, as he
            examines the tiny dots of gold that represent the day’s work. “And if we don’t find any, we’re depressed,

            In 2006, the national average salary was about $60 a month, yet miners can easily make three or four times
            that amount.

            <br>
            <br>

            Robin Grayson, founder of Eco-Minex International, an environmental and mining consultancy, wrote one of the
            first reports on the ninja phenomenon.

            <br>
            <br>

            “With one-sixth of the population somehow involved, [ninja mining] is an enormous cash-kick to the economy,”
            he says. “Otherwise, the rural areas have almost nothing.”

        <p>Grayson believes the ninjas should be legalized and allocated land for small-scale mining.
            <br>
            <br>
            “The main objection is that the official gold rush has been so fast and furious that nearly all the land has
            been taken up with exploration licenses or is already state-protected because of wildlife considerations,”
            he explains.</p>

            In the past, the mining area of Uyanga — about 300 miles southwest of the capital, Ulan Bator — was pretty
            much up for grabs, swarming with ninja miners who staked their claims wherever they pleased.
            <br>
            <br>
            But the ninjas say in the past year dozens of larger mining companies have divided up the best land, hemming
            the ninjas into ever smaller spaces. Nergui, who like many Mongolians goes by only one name, says the
            companies act with impunity against the ninjas.
            <br>

            The environmental damage of the gold rush is clear. Once-green grasslands have been ripped up and streams

            <br>
            <br>
            In other parts of the country where hard-rock mining is practiced, the ninjas are literally poisoning the
            landscape with the chemicals needed to extract the gold, according to Arshad Sayed, the World Bank’s

            “The negative side is people using chemicals like cyanide, mercury, others, which are very detrimental to

            Their tally is sobering: They say mining has caused 850 rivers and more than 1,000 lakes to go dry. They

            In Uyanga, the impact of mining is clear. A new breed of nomad is emerging, going wherever the gold is
            rumored to be to mine or provide services for the ninjas. It’s a sign of Mongolia’s changing economy. Once
            based on herding, it’s now heavily dependent on mining.
